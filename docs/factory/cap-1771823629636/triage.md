## Scope Context
- Organization: Acme Health
- Sandbox: Production Sandbox
- Product: CRM
- Active capabilities: 3
- Blocked capabilities: 1

## Refined Idea
- Problem statement: Traditional CDPs are very old fashioned and doesn't typical use AI and don't have ways to deal with the age of agents. We are going to open a new workstream to implement a new CDP system using agentic methodology. We are also going to market to agents. We are also going to market to humans directly. We will chat and conversations as native construct in the system

## Suggestions
- Clarify measurable outcome and success metric for first release.
- Add explicit non-goals to prevent scope drift.
- Attach one architecture sketch or reference diagram.
- Map the capability to org/sandbox/product dependency constraints.
